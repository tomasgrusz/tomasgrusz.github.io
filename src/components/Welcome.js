      <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Tomas, and I am an international student from Slovakia
        studying B.Sc. Computer Science at University of Birmingham. The first
        time I came in contact with computer technology was over 15 years ago,
        playing my brotherâ€™s video game. I was eager to explore all the
        mysteries behind it. Since then, computer science and programming have
        been my passion, inspiring me to delve into everything the field has to
        offer. Among others, I am known as a kind and determined person. I like
        being a part of teams and joining forces to get over obstacles
        efficiently. Passionate about my studies, I also have no problem
        spending countless hours studying and practising on my own. In my spare
        time, I deepen my knowledge through various online courses, tutorials,
        and community projects. Moreover, I love working on personal
        mini-projects, so that I can practise what I have learnt, gain more
        experience in problem-solving, not to mention challenge my creativity.
        My dream is to create inspiring and entertaining applications, as well
        as help others solve problems. I am aspiring to build a diverse
        portfolio of projects and become a part of a great community of
        colleagues.
